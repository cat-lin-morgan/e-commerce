# SQL: CRUD and E-Commerce
## Description

This was a project to build the back end for an e-commerce site, using the Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database.

I used three Node Package Modules: [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize), and [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Installation 

First star it. 
Then you could either fork it or download a zip file of it.

You should also have Node and MySQL installed to your machine.

Then hit ```npm i``` to install all of the packages included in the package.json file.

## Usage

**All of the details for npm shortcuts were stored in the package.json**

Replace with your own info in the config/connection.js

Login into MySQL and the ```use ecommerce_db``` and then ```show tables``` ton confirm it worked.

```npm run seed``` to set up some starter data for your base.

```npm start``` will run the application.

## Credits

My cohort's TA, **Leticia**, helped me in getting my TABLES up and running, and my tutor, **Ben Abbot**, helped me get my files all set up.
